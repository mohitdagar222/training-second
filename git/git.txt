SSH keypair setup for GitHub 
Create a repo.
Make sure there is at least one file in it.

Generate a SSH key pair (private/public):
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096  -C "your_email@example.com"

ssh-keygen -t ed25519  -C "your_email@example.com"
  OR
 ssh-keygen

Copy the contents of the public SSH key -
macOS:
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Linux (requires the xclip package):
 $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
 
 //#beryl git account
    Host github.com-beryl
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    
 //
 chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
 
 eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
 ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Copy the public SSH key to GitHub
Copy the contents of the to your SSH keys to your GitHub account settings

create a new repository on the command line

echo "# training" >> README.md or cat > sum.java
git init -it makes our folder git repo
git add README.md or sum.java.    git add . (all files will come to staging area)
git commit -m "first commit" filename(add only new file in staging area but if we updated a file than only commit followed by file name )
git commit -i filename (after conflict resolved manually)
git remote add origin git@github.com:mohitdagar222/training.git
git push -u origin master


git checkout (commit-id) —to revert to a specific commit or navigate between commits and branches
git checkout master —to revert changes to the master commit


git branch (to show all the branches)
git branch dev(branch name)  (to create a new branch)
git checkout -b mohit(branch name). (to create a branch and checkout in it )
git checkout -b mohit master (to cut a branch with all its contents )

To rename a Git branch, run the following command: git branch -m <old> <new>. This will change the name of the branch you are viewing to the new name you specify. You do not need to specify the old branch name if you want to rename the branch you are viewing.

git merge (branch name) (to merge a branch ,first move to that branch and run the command and enter the name of branch to be merged) 

delete branch locally
git branch -d localBranchName

 delete branch remotely
git push origin --delete remoteBranchName

 git pull origin (branch name)

git clone https://github.com/mohitdagar222/training.git(to clone the repo in local system)

git rm filename (to delete a file from git ,commit changes and push it)

git rm -r reponame ( to delete a repo )



git remote add

While the clone command is used to get an existing repository from a server, if you want to set up a remote server for a repository you have on your local machine, you will use the remote add command.
