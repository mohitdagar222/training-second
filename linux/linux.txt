		
	Linux Basic Commands-                  

	1. pwd Command - The pwd command is used to display the location of the current working directory.
	Syntax: pwd
	output: /users/beryl/Desktop

	2. mkdir Command - The mkdir command is used to create a new directory under any directory.
	syntax: mkdir <directory name> 
	output: prashantaggaral@Beryl-Systems Desktop % mkdir linux
	prashantaggaral@Beryl-Systems Desktop % 

		Linux Directories mkdir -p: With the help of mkdir -p command you can create sub-directories of a directory. It will create parent directory first, if it 	doesn't exist. But if it already exists, then it will not print an error message and will move further to create sub-directories.
	output:prashantaggaral@Beryl-Systems Desktop % mkdir -p created/new
	prashantaggaral@Beryl-Systems Desktop % cd created
	prashantaggaral@Beryl-Systems created % ls
	

		Linux Directories mkdir -v: mkdir -v' command will print a message with every new file created.
	output:prashantaggaral@Beryl-Systems created % mkdir -v file1 file2 file3
	mkdir: created directory 'file1'
	mkdir: created directory 'file2'
	mkdir: created directory 'file3'
	prashantaggaral@Beryl-Systems created % ls
	file1	file2	file3	new

		mkdir -pv/ mkdir -vp: Both the commands 'mkdir -pv' and 'mkdir -vp' are same. By combining -p you can create a long list files together like "office/client/	raj/date/day"with a printed message for each file.
	output:prashantaggaral@Beryl-Systems created %mkdir -pv mohit/ajay
	mkdir: created directory 'mohit'
	mkdir: created directory 'mohit/ajay'

		Linux Directories mkdir -m=MODE: With the help of this command, you can access the permission on the directory you are creating. Access means to 	give the authority to read(r), write(w), and execute(x). You can access the permission in different ways to your directory.
	*For full access, command will be:
	"mkdir -m=rwx <file>"  
	*For read and write, command will be:
	"mkdir -m=rw <file>"  
	*For read only/ write only/ execute only, command will be:
	"mkdir -m=r <file>"/ "mkdir -m=w <file>"/ "mkdir -m=x <file>"/  
	output:prashantaggaral@Beryl-Systems created % mkdir -m=rwx mohitdagar
	prashantaggaral@Beryl-Systems created % ls
	file1		file3		new
	file2		mohitdagar	office 




	3. rmdir Command - The rmdir command is used to delete a directory.But will not be able to delete a directory including a sub-directory. It means, a directory 	has to be empty to be deleted.
	syntax: rmdir <directory name> 
	output:  prashantaggaral@Beryl-Systems Desktop % rmdir linux
	prashantaggaral@Beryl-Systems Desktop % 

		*rmdir -p: This command will delete a directory including its sub-directories all at once. In below picture, all sub-directories have been deleted with 'rmdir 	-p' command.
	output:prashantaggaral@Beryl-Systems created % mkdir -p kk/mk/jk
	prashantaggaral@Beryl-Systems created % ls
	file1		file3		mohitdagar	office
	file2		kk		new
	prashantaggaral@Beryl-Systems created % rmdir -p kk/mk/jk
	prashantaggaral@Beryl-Systems created % ls
	file1		file3		new
	file2		mohitdagar	office

	4. ls Command - The ls command is used to display a list of content of a directory.
	Syntax:ls  
	output:prashantaggaral@Beryl-Systems Desktop % ls
 	Beryls		new_directory


	ls -a	In Linux, hidden files start with . (dot) symbol and they are not visible in the regular directory. The (ls -a) command will enlist the whole list of the current directory including the hidden files.
	ls -l	It will show the list in a long list format.
	ls -lh	This command will show you the file sizes in human readable format. Size of the file is very difficult to read when displayed in terms of byte. The (ls -lh)command will give you the data in terms of Mb, Gb, Tb, etc.
	ls -lhS	If you want to display your files in descending order (highest at the top) according to their size, then you can use (ls -lhS) command.
	ls -l - -block-size=[SIZE]	It is used to display the files in a specific size format. Here, in [SIZE] you can assign size according to your requirement.
	ls -d */	It is used to display only subdirectories.
	ls -g or ls -lG	With this you can exclude column of group information and owner.
	ls -n	It is used to print group ID and owner ID instead of their names.
	ls --color=[VALUE]	This command is used to print list as colored or discolored.
	ls -li	This command prints the index number if file is in the first column.
	ls -p	It is used to identify the directory easily by marking the directories with a slash (/) line sign.
	ls -r	It is used to print the list in reverse order.
	ls -R	It will display the content of the sub-directories also.
	ls -lX	It will group the files with same extensions together in the list.
	ls -lt	It will sort the list by displaying recently modified filed at top.
	ls ~	It gives the contents of home directory.
	ls ../	It give the contents of parent directory.
	ls --version	It checks the version of ls command.


 	5. cd Command - The cd command is used to change the current directory.
 	Syntax:cd <directory name> 
 	output:prashantaggaral@Beryl-Systems beryl % cd Desktop 
	prashantaggaral@Beryl-Systems Desktop % 

		Change directory using an absolute path:To change the directory by using an absolute path, we have to mention the whole path starting from the root. 
		Syntax:run/cups/certs

	Change directory using a relative path:We can change our directory by using a relative path; a relative path is a location that is relative to the current directory

	To create a file, execute it as follows:

	cat > <file name>  
	// Enter file content  
	Press "CTRL+ D" keys to save the file. To display the content of the file, execute it as follows:

	cat <file name>

	Linux cp -r:Option 'r' with the copy command can be used to copy a directory including all its content from a source directory to the destination directory.
		 Syntax:cp -r <sourceDirectory> <destinationDirectory>  

	Linux Copy multiple files or directories:Multiple files or directories can be copied to a destination directory at once. In this case, target must be a directory. To copy multiple files you can use wildcards (cp *.extension) having same 	pattern.
		Syntax:cp *.<extension> <destinationDirectory>

	Linux cp --backup:If the file you want to copy already exists in the destination directory, you can backup your existing file with the use of this command.
		Syntax:cp --backup <filename> <destinationDirectory> 

	Linux cp -i: The cp '-i' option allows you to confirm once before overwriting your file.
		Syntax:cp -i <filename> <destinationDirectory> 

	10. mv Command:Linux mv command is used to move existing file or directory from one location to another. It is also used to rename a file or directory. If you want to rename a single directory or file then 'mv' option will be better to 	use.
			Syntax:mv a ab (renamed)

		Linux File mv -i:If you want to copy a file using 'mv' option and if that file already exists then it will silently over write the existing file.But if you'll use 'i' option then it will first ask for your permission to over write it.

		Linux File mv *:This command is used to move all the files from the current directory to another specified directory at once.
			Syntax:mv * /home/beryls

		Linux File mv -u:When you'll use mv *, it moves all the files to the destination directory. But when you use 'u' option, files that already exist in the destination directory will be automtically skipped and all the other files will be 	copied.

	11. rename Command:To rename a file there are other commands also like 'mv'. But 'rename' command is slightly advanced then others. 
		Syntax:rename 's/old-name/new-name/' files  

	12. head Command:The head command is used to display the content of a file. It displays the first 10 lines of a file.
			Syntax:head <file name> 

			Head command for multiple files:If we'll write two file names then it will display first ten lines (in this case file has five lines only) of each file separated by a heading.

			Syntax:head <file name> <file name>  

			Linux head -n:The 'head -n' option displays specified number of lines.

		Syntax:head -n <file name>  
		Example:head -15 jtp.txt

		Syntax:tac <file name>

	15. more command:The more command is quite similar to the cat command, as it is used to display the file content in the same way that the cat command does. The only difference between both commands is that, in case of larger 	files, the more command displays screenful output at a time.
		Syntax:more <file name>

	16. less Command:The less command is similar to the more command. It also includes some extra features such as 'adjustment in width and height of the terminal.' Comparatively, the more command cuts the output in the width of the 	terminal.
